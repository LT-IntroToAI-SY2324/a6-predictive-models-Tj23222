# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
It gives you more detailed response and predicts possible outcomes from the data You give it, and uses unseen data to preict


2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
It stills tell you abut how bes fit and if its relastic for the dependant to actually be effected

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
I think the model is slightly accurate but like every model wil have  a marjon of error as blood pressure doesn always connect with ag and many othe factors can come in,he actual values seem to be off alot but the predictions only have limited data to go off of
