# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
My r sqared value is 0.86 and relates to the accurateness of the model
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
MY model is semi accurate with 0.86 being very close to 1.0 correlation 
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
A 10 year old car with 89000 miles is worth $9318.90 A car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles is worth $2062.17
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?Since the mileage is so high it goes out of the scope of the data given and becomes non realalsitic for the program
