# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model? It Gives you the proportion and corelation of the dependant to he indepndant with 1 being a perfect fit.

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
The predicted systolic blood preussure is 137.46185286

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
I think the models are slightly accurate but person to person will alays vary and i think they should encoun mor for outliars or have another model wih othe aspects of blood pressure.
